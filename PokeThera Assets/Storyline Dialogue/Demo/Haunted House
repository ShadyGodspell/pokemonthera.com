When the player enters the house they hear a little kid saying,
"Where is my doll!?"

To begin the rest of the quest they have to talk to the kid who is in a corner looking at the corner.

After they talk to her she will reply with,
"Heh..."

"Heh... "

"Heh... "

"I let her out"

"..."

"My doll annabelle wanted to go for a walk, so I let her this one time!"

"Will you help me get her back? Pretty Please..."

 "Heh..."
 
 To continue the quest the player has to talk to the mom thats sitting at the table
 
 The mom replies with,
 "Is my daughter possessed? Of course not! She's just different."
 
 After this a doll appears in the corner. When the player talks to it, it teleports  to a different side of the room,
 after the player talks to it, it teleports to the forest behind/by a tree, after they talk to it again, it teleports to the cave, 
 and then the daughter is standing next to it in the corner of the cave.
 
 If the player talks to the doll it will reply with,
 "..."
 
 If the player talks to the girl she will reply with,
 "WHY DIDN'T YOU FIND MY DOLL?!"
 
 "WHY DO I HAVE TO DO EVERYTHING MYSELF!"
 
 After that the player is teleported back to the house and the girl is looking at the wall again with the doll at the table next to the mom.
 
 When the player talks to the mom the mom will reply with,
 "My daughter said you helped her get Annabelle back!
 Thank you very much!"
 
 When the player talks to the doll it replies with,
 "Wanna Play..?"
 
 "Heh..."
 
 When the player talks to the little girl now she replies with,
"For your pathetic attempt to find my doll you get nothing..."
 
"alright fine..."

"You can have this I guess..."

"It belonged to the last person who tried to help me..."

 
 The player now receives a Shiny Gothita.

 
 "What happened to him?
 
 "Why do you ask so many questions?
 
 "GO AWAY!"

If the player tries to talk to anyone after this they all don't respond

End of quest
