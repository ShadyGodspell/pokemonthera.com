Theo (Or any NPC) the Archaeologist!
Starts in a certain house where the player spawns and gets a starter. (Eevee, Vulpix, or Zorua)
Theo talks to the player immediately after they spawn and says,
"Listen... I don't have time to explain! Just take one already!"

The player chooses a starter and receives it here.

"Now that you have a partner for all of your adventures, I need you to meet me at the Desert. Its literally to the left of Nara town."
The player now can walk around. If he tries to go into the other 3 regions or into any of the houses, the houses will say that they are locked. 
If he tries to go to a different region, then the message,
"Help!" That sounds like Theo. It sounds like he's in trouble.

After they finally get to the desert, the player is automatically forced to walk over to Theo.
Theo then says,
"I see some unfriendly travelers to the west of the desert..."

The player then needs to walk to the far left of the desert. If it tries to leave Theo says,
"Where are you going?"

After the player finally makes his way to the west of the desert, he sees a Team Plasma grunt.
The team plasma grunt approaches the player and then says,
"The mythical Pokemon will be mine, and there is nothing you can do about it!"

Skyla the ex gym leader than walks in from the right and says,
"Team Plasma? I thought all of you disbanded years ago! What are you doing in Nara?"

The grunt then replies with,
"Hmph, I don't have to say anything to someone as irrelevant as yourself."

The grunt then leaves off the screen to the east.

Skyla then says to the player,
"Hello there! My name is Skyla. I used to be the flying type gym leader in the Unova region."
