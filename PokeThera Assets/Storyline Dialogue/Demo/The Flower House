Talk to this NPC to make the quest begin

NPC replies with,
"Do you like flowers?
My husband buys me flowers all the time, but this time he came home with two rare flower Pokemon...
Would you like one?
I'm trading her for a quilava!"

Then offers to trade it if the trainer owns quilava.
If the trainer has a quilava, then the trainer gets a female flabebe for quilava.

After the trade is finished, the NPC replies with,
"Take good care of her!"

If the player doesn't have a quilava and doesn't trade then they reply with,
"Awe.. You don't have a quilava..."

If the player has a quilava and doesn't want to trade then the NPC replies with,
"Let me know if you change your mind!"
