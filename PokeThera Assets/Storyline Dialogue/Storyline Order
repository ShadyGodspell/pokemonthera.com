Demo only skins!!

First the player spawns in a house, and the main story quest begins when the player walks outside. This is where they get their starter and 10 Pokeballs, 10 Great Balls, and 10 Ultra Balls.
After they get their starter, N walks up to them and introduces them to everything.

N's Dialogue:
"Excuse me, my name is Natural Harmonia Gropius, but you may call me N for short.
What you see before you is the town of Nara. 
Nara has multiple features to it. A few of them are the Pokecenter, the Mart, a Gym, and a Puzzle House.
To the west of the town you can find the desert, and directly to the east of the town is the forest of Jura.
To the north of the town is a Mountain, and located to the south of the town is the ocean."
"I hope to see you again."

He then walks off the screen.

All stories after that are contact based. (The player has to talk to someone to start a story)
